If you don't already have it, install the SQLite Browser from http://sqlitebrowser.org/.

Then, create a SQLITE database or use an existing database and create a table in the database called "Ages":

CREATE TABLE Ages ( 
  name VARCHAR(128), 
  age INTEGER
)
Then make sure the table is empty by deleting any rows that you previously inserted, and insert these rows and only these rows with the following commands:

DELETE FROM Ages;
INSERT INTO Ages (name, age) VALUES ('Uzma', 21);
INSERT INTO Ages (name, age) VALUES ('Teegan', 38);
INSERT INTO Ages (name, age) VALUES ('Jada', 21);
INSERT INTO Ages (name, age) VALUES ('Eloise', 40);
INSERT INTO Ages (name, age) VALUES ('Ellae', 19);

Once the inserts are done, run the following SQL command:

# SELECT hex(name || age) AS X FROM Ages ORDER BY X
